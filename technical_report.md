# Technical Report: Drone Network Attack Detection System

## 1. Dataset Analysis

### Data Source

- Used drone network traffic data
- Contains information about normal and attack patterns
- Features include: packet size, protocol type, source/destination IPs, and timestamps

### Data Preparation

- Cleaned missing values by filling with appropriate defaults
- Converted text data (like TCP/UDP) into numbers for the model
- Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets

## 2. Machine Learning Model

### Model Choice

- Selected Random Forest Classifier because:
  - Easy to understand
  - Works well with different types of data
  - Can handle both normal and attack patterns effectively

### Model Performance

- Accuracy: How often the model is correct
- Precision: How accurate the attack detections are
- Recall: How many actual attacks are caught
- F1-Score: Overall balance of precision and recall

### Model Features Used

1. Network Traffic Features:
   - Packet size (bytes)
   - Protocol type (TCP/UDP)
   - Source and destination IPs
   - Time-based features (hour, minute)

## 3. Dashboard Development

### Frontend Features

1. Real-Time Display:

   - Current attack status
   - Historical attack graph
   - Simple alert messages

2. User Interface:
   - Clean, simple design
   - Easy-to-read graphs
   - Clear status indicators

### Backend Integration

1. API Endpoints:

   - /predict: Receives new traffic data
   - Updates dashboard in real-time

2. Data Flow:
   - Receives network traffic
   - Processes through model
   - Shows results on dashboard

## 4. Testing Results

### System Testing

1. Normal Traffic:

   - Regular packet sizes
   - Common protocols
   - Expected response times

2. Attack Scenarios:
   - Large packet sizes (DoS attempts)
   - Unusual protocols
   - Suspicious patterns

### Performance Metrics

- Response Time: Under 1 second
- Update Speed: Real-time
- Resource Usage: Minimal

## 5. Deployment

### Requirements

1. Software Needed:

   - Python 3.7 or higher
   - Required Python packages (in requirements.txt)
   - Web browser for dashboard

2. System Requirements:
   - Basic computer (no special hardware needed)
   - Internet connection
   - Enough memory to run Python

### Installation Steps

1. Install Python packages
2. Start the system
3. Access dashboard
4. Begin monitoring

## 6. Future Improvements

### Possible Additions

1. More Features:

   - Email notifications
   - Mobile app support
   - Custom alert rules

2. Enhanced Detection:
   - More attack types
   - Better accuracy
   - Faster response

## 7. Conclusion

The system successfully:

- Detects network attacks
- Shows results clearly
- Works in real-time
- Is easy to use

Most importantly, it meets the goal of being simple to understand and explain to others.
